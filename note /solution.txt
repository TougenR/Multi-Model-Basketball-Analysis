1) TRAINING 2 MODEL (ball-detector, player-detector)
    - train two models: player-detector(100 epochs) and ball-detector(250 epochs).

2) WORKING ON: player-detector module
    - Detect person on each frame
    - Person re-id for person tracking problem: SOLUTION: bytetrack algorithm

3) WORKING ON: ball-detector module
    - Detect ball on each frame (choose the highest confidence score)
    - PROBLEM: There are some wrong and miss predict ball positions
        => SOLUTION: Delete wrong predict, and fill the miss predict with interpolation module

4) Ball acquisition








3 point shots recognition:
    - using resnet50
    - annotation stephen curry for 3 point shot pose
